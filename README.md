Project Description
In this project, we’ll build a CV generator application using Django to enable users to automatically create CVs and download them in PDF format. We’ll use SQLite to manage the database and Bootstrap for styling.

The application will let users complete a multi-step form by entering their personal information, education, interests, work experience, and skills. It will generate a well-formatted CV upon clicking the “Create” button.
